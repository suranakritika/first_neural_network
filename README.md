# First Neural Network

## Project descriptionThe objective of this study is to develop a deep learning model that will predict from historical
## data that how many bike you will need in a near future. It is a project based on daily bike rental
## ship.

## The network has two layers, a hidden layer and an output layer. The hidden layer will use the
## sigmoid function for activations. The output layer has only one node and is used for the
## regression, the output of the node is the same as the input of the node. That is, the activation
## function is f(x) = x. A function that takes the input signal and generates an output signal, but takes
## into account the threshold, is called an activation function. We work through each layer of our
## network calculating the outputs for each neuron. All of the outputs from one layer become inputs
## to the neurons on the next layer.
## We use the weights to propagate signals forward from the input to the output layers in a neural
## network. We use the weights to also propagate error backwards from the output back into the
## network to update our weights.
